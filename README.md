# Ship Remote Autopilot

Gives the player the ability to remotely "summon" the player's ship to a selected location. This is "new" technology from The Outer Wilds Ventures and as such- is fairly rudimentary.

# How do I use the Remote Autopilot?
1. Using the key options laid out below, choose a destination for the autopilot to select.
2. When you press the activation key, the ship will take off upwards for 10 seconds to clear itself from any surface its on.
3. The ship will then activate the normal autopilot and fly towards the destination.

Notes - 
- THIS TECHNOLOGY IS FOR ATTEMPTS AT A "LAST RESORT" RESCUE IF YOU ARE STRANDED ON A PLANET, DO *NOT* ATTEMPT TO USE IT AS YOUR NORMAL MODE OF TRANSPORTATION.

- LANDING TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT YET BEEN INVENTED, THE SHIP WILL DECEND SLOWLY FROM ORBIT. *PLEASE BE AWARE THAT DAMAGE WILL LIKELY OCCUR ON THE SHIP.*

- CAUTION - DO NOT BE INSIDE THE SHIP DURING TRANSIT, THIS IS ILL ADVISED AND WILL LIKELY END UP IN YOUR UNTIMELY DEMISE.

# Controls
In Settings, there is an "Alternate Keys" option. If enabled, the keys to control the autopilot will be changed to support keyboards that do not have a Number Pad. 

*PLEASE NOTE, THIS COULD COLLIDE WITH FUNCTIONALITY OF OTHER MODS.*
